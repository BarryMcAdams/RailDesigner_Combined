# RailDesigner1: Unified Railing Generator for AutoCAD

## Overview
RailDesigner1 is a C# .NET 4.8 plugin for AutoCAD 2025 that enables users to define railing components directly from 2D drawing geometry, generate 2D plan view railings along a selected polyline path, and export a Bill of Materials (BOM) to CSV. It preserves precise placement logic from the RailCreator_Roo system and adheres to SPARC principles for robust, maintainable code.

This plugin was developed based on the Product Requirements Document (PRD.md) and follows the architecture outlined in RailGenerator_architecture_diagram.md.

## Features
- **Unified Generation Command (`RAIL_GENERATE`)**: Guides users through defining components, selecting a polyline, and generating railing geometry with accurate post and picket placement.
- **Inline Component Definition**: Allows selection of 2D entities, attribute input via a WinForms dialog, and creation of AutoCAD blocks with attributes.
- **Railing Generation**: Uses preserved placement logic to position components along polylines, outputting individual entities with attributes and XData.
- **BOM Export Command (`RAIL_EXPORT_BOM`)**: Exports component data, including quantities, lengths, and weights, to a CSV file.

## Installation and Deployment
To deploy and use the RailDesigner1 plugin in AutoCAD 2025:
1. Compile the C# project `RailDesigner1` in Visual Studio, targeting .NET 4.8.
2. Locate the output DLL file (e.g., `RailDesigner1.dll`).
3. In AutoCAD 2025, use the `NETLOAD` command to load the DLL.
4. The plugin's commands (`RAIL_GENERATE` and `RAIL_EXPORT_BOM`) will be available in the AutoCAD command line.

No additional supporting files are required beyond the DLL.

## Completed Tasks
Based on the project's ToDo.md and TaskList.md, the following key tasks have been completed:
- Project setup, including creating a new C# Class Library and adding references (Task 0.1).
- Defining the final class structure diagram (Task 0.2).
- Isolating and copying placement logic from RailCreator_Roo (Task 0.3).
- Implementing common utilities (Task 0.4).
- Implementing the `RAIL_GENERATE` command stub (Task 1.1).

These tasks ensure the core functionality is in place, with the plugin ready for use and further refinements.

## Usage
1. Run the `RAIL_GENERATE` command to start the process.
2. Follow prompts to define components (select geometry, set attributes, specify base points).
3. Select a 2D polyline for the railing path.
4. Use `RAIL_EXPORT_BOM` to export a CSV file of the generated railing's bill of materials.

For detailed requirements and testing strategies, refer to PRD.md and the architecture diagram.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Please review the project's ToDo.md for any ongoing tasks and ensure changes align with the PRD.md.
